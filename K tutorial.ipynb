    "Different computer languages have different methods of handling arrays. Python arrays can store a variable amount of different data types, wheras in java, and array can only store a fixed amount of a specific data type. However, what most of these languages have in common is that they treat arrays as lists of data, and use loops to traverse through them in linear time. K is unique, as it instead treats arrays more like vectors in mathematics than lists of data. As a result, most scalar operations can be generalized nicely to arrays."
